TITLE:
E-Commerce Delivery Optimization System
Objectives:
- To simulate and optimize delivery routes for e-commerce logistics.
- To minimize delivery time and cost using algorithmic techniques.
- To visualize delivery paths using interactive maps.
- To demonstrate real-world use of optimization algorithms in logistics.
Introduction:
The E-Commerce Delivery Optimization System is a web-based project designed to demonstrate how online delivery companies plan routes and manage delivery efficiency using the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the system visualizes optimized delivery routes to minimize distance and time.
Algorithm/Technique used:
Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP):
• Purpose: Finds the shortest possible route to visit all delivery cities and return to the start point.
• Explanation: It calculates all possible routes and selects the one with the minimum total distance.
• Diagram: Visual map shown in the project interface — cities connected forming an optimized loop.
Time Complexity and its explanation:
Travelling Salesman Problem (Brute Force): O(n!) — checks every possible route for the shortest distance.
Results:
UI and Output Summary:
• The user selects the number of cities.
• The system generates random delivery points on a map.
• The TSP algorithm computes and draws the optimized delivery route.
• The log panel displays the best route sequence and total distance.
(Screenshots can be attached below.)
Conclusion and Future Scope:
This project successfully demonstrates the working of the Travelling Salesman Problem in optimizing delivery routes. It visually represents the shortest route for efficient e-commerce delivery. Future improvements may include real GPS data, AI-based route prediction, and integration with real-time delivery tracking APIs.
